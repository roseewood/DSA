Lab-2 (Algorithmic Design for Computer Application)

Objective:

 ---Singly linked list ---

1) You are a treasure hunter exploring an ancient, mysterious cave filled with hidden treasures. As you venture deeper into the cave, you discover a series of locked chests arranged in a line, each containing a single golden coin. However, each coin has a different value, and you can only take the coin with the highest value.
To help you decide which coin to take, you need to write a program that can traverse through the chests (represented as a singly linked list) and find the coin with the maximum value.

- Input:
i) Line 1 reads the size of the linked list (Size must be greater than 0)
i) Line 2 reads linked list elements

- Output:
i) Print the max element of the linked list
Note: For linked list creation the elements are allowed to insert at the beginning only.

2) Given a singly linked list representing the chain of lockers, where each node contains a secret code, and an integer 𝑁, write a program to find the value of the Nth locker from the end of the list. If N is greater than the total number of lockers (i.e., the length of the list), return -1.

i) Input:
- Line 1 reads the size of the linked list (Size must be greater than 0)
- Line 2 reads linked list elements
○ Line 3 reads nth element to be printed from the end (n must be greater than 0)

ii) Output:
- Print the nth element from the end of the linked list
- Note: For linked list creation the elements are allowed to insert at the beginning only.
