Lab-2 (Algorithmic Design for Computer Application)

Objective:

 ---Singly linked list ---

1) You are a treasure hunter exploring an ancient, mysterious cave filled with hidden treasures. As you venture deeper into the cave, you discover a series of locked chests arranged in a line, each containing a single golden coin. However, each coin has a different value, and you can only take the coin with the highest value.
To help you decide which coin to take, you need to write a program that can traverse through the chests (represented as a singly linked list) and find the coin with the maximum value.

- Input:
i) Line 1 reads the size of the linked list (Size must be greater than 0)
i) Line 2 reads linked list elements

- Output:
i) Print the max element of the linked list
Note: For linked list creation the elements are allowed to insert at the beginning only.
